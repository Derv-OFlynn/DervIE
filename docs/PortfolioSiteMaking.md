# Hello! 

This is a an amateur guide to Potfolio Sites. The purpose of this document is to share the process of making a site and make the process less scary, it is more user-friendly information than a tech tutorial.

# What is in a website?

Websites are made up of a series of files that are linked together. The files you will see in your website folders are these:
- **.html files:** HyperText Markup Language (HTML) are the files that each represent a page on your site like the home page, the contact page, etc.
- **.php files** Hypertext PreProcessor (PHP) files are similar to .html files but are used to "DO" a bit more with the site by inserting scripts in the html. They are used mostly when websites change as a response to input (logging in, updating times). A lot of the time, php files interact with databases.
- **.css file(s):** Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the styling and decoration files for your site. By having all the decoration settings in one file it means you only need to write a setting once and you will be able to use it multiple times on the website. This gives consistency. You will usually only have one .css file in a site but you can have more.
- **.ico files:** "ico" is short for icon. This is a type of image format used specifically for website icons, like the ones that show up in an address bar.
- **.md files:** Markdown (md) files are used for making nice looking documentation (like this file!) They have a universal format and are sometimes easier to work with than .docx files.
- **.js files:** JavaScript (JS) files are used for "scripting". It makes the website "DO" things that are too complex to implement in the html or css files. Examples include fancy buttons, image manipulation, etc.
- **.gitignore file:** It is a file used by developers to customise "version control". Think of version control like video game save files. Don't worry about this if you see it.
- **.png, .jpeg files:** image files. 
- **.webp files:** a type of image and gif file sometimes used in websites. It is the same quality as .png and .jpeg but with a smaller file size as the format was created for the web. It is not a very common format due to difficulties editing this file as many editors do not support it.
- **.mov, .mp4, .gif files:** video files. 



# Website links

Websites are accessed using Uniform Resource Locators (URLs), also known as an **address**

```https://derv.ie/index.html```

is a URL that directs to the home page of the ```derv.ie``` website. Let's break this down.

- ```https://``` OR ```http://``` stand for Hyper Text Transfer Protocol. It is the name of the request and response cycle between the machine wanting to view a website and the machine hosting the site. The "s" in ```https://``` stands for "Secure" and means that the data being sent is encrypted.
